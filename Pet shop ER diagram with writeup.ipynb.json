    "For our Entity Diagram for the Pet Shop Lab, we have ten tables. \n",
    "\n",
    "The Aquarium table is connected to the Fish table the same way the Enclosure table is connected to the Pet table. These are separated because as stated, in the prompt the manager wanted separate tables for the purchases between pets and fish. In these tables, it has both primary and foreign keys along with other attributes to describe what is needed to know to make the diagram. Both pet and fish are the primary keys for their table, while they are foreign keys in the enclosure and aquarium tables. Then once again with the pet and fish primary keys, they are foreign keys in the AnimalTransactions table, therefore we connected these tables together. Also connected to the Animal Transaction table is the Customer table, where the customer id is a foreign key in the Animal Transaction table. \n",
    "\n",
    "Connected to the Customer table is both the Loyalty Program table, where it becomes the foreign key, and the Food Transaction table. The relationship between these tables is through the purchase of the customer. And connected to the Food Transaction table are the last two tables, which happen to be the foreign keys in this table, the Pet Food and Fish Food tables. Both Pet and Fish food Ids are also used as foreign keys to keep track of exactly which foods have been sold for inventory purposes. Both pet and fish food are kept in two separate tables to keep with the theme of keeping fish and pets separate, as instructed by the manager.  \n",
    "\n",
    "Each table has their own primary key, the id number, that is named the same as the table. Fishid for the Fish table, Customerid for the Customer table, and so on. Also, in each table is the accompanying attributes that is relevant to entity listed. In the Aquarium table, all that is listed is there to describe what is needed to about the aquarium. The size, what goes into it, the water type, and how much can it hold. The tables are also connected by the relationships, connectivity, and cardinality. Between the Aquarium and Fish tables, the connectivity and cardinality is a one to many relationship because one fish can be in only one aquarium and many fish can be in one aquarium. \n"
